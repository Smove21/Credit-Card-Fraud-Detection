Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Description:
Implemented a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, contributing to financial security and risk mitigation efforts. Utilized a dataset containing credit card transactions, where fraudulent transactions were rare occurrences. Employed Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics, including feature distributions and class imbalances.
Employed data preprocessing techniques, including scaling and feature engineering, to prepare the data for model training.
Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to identify the most effective model for fraud detection.
Implemented cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance robustness and mitigate overfitting.
Generated a confusion matrix and calculated evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
Collaborated with stakeholders to interpret the model results, identify areas for improvement, and refine the fraud detection system.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
Successfully developed and deployed a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions, contributing to enhanced financial security and fraud prevention efforts. This project showcased strong analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and expertise in machine learning techniques.
